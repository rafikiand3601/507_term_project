This project is our group\textquotesingle{}s term project for the M\+E-\/507 class at Cal Poly. ~\newline
The goal of this project is to develop our own board to control a model car, which will track and follow a transponder. The inital idea for this project was to make a model car that fetches a ball, but this was modified so that it could be more practical. \hypertarget{index_TODO}{}\section{T\+O\+DO}\label{index_TODO}
