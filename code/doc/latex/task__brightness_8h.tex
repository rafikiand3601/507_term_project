\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the header for a task class that controls the brightness of an L\+ED using a voltage measured from the A/D as input. The fun part\+: the brightness that is being controlled can be on another A\+VR computer, with signals being sent and received via wireless transceivers.

Revisions\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 09-\/30-\/2012 J\+RR Original file was a one-\/file demonstration with two tasks \item 10-\/05-\/2012 J\+RR Split into multiple files, one for each task \item 10-\/25-\/2012 J\+RR Changed to a more fully C++ version with class task\+\_\+sender \item 10-\/27-\/2012 J\+RR Altered from data sending task into L\+ED blinking class \item 11-\/04-\/2012 J\+RR Altered again into the multi-\/task monstrosity \item 12-\/13-\/2012 J\+RR Yet again transmogrified; now it controls L\+ED brightness\end{DoxyItemize}
